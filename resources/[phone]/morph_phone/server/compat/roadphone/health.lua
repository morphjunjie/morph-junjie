-- morph_phone's Health app simulates its readings on the CLIENT - steps, distance and heart rate are
-- sampled from the ped's own activity in client/apps/health.lua and pushed straight into the UI.
-- Nothing is cached server-side and nothing is written to a daily table, so every server-side read
-- here reports RoadPhone's own documented default rather than a made-up figure, and every write
-- reports that it stored nothing. A caller gated on "is the health addon on" therefore behaves
-- exactly as it would against a RoadPhone install with the addon switched off.
---@type string The clause every reader in this file shares.
