-- Dynamic Island / lock-screen activity cards. morph_phone has a real equivalent in its lock-screen
-- widgets, but that surface is deliberately owned by the resource that registered the app carrying
-- it (exports['morph_phone']:addCustomApp, then showLockscreenWidget from the same resource). A shim
-- calling it would register every card as morph_phone's own and no caller could ever remove one, so
-- these report false and name the path to use instead rather than opening a card nobody owns.
