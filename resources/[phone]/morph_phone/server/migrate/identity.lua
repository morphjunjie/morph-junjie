---Builds the identity context: reads every lb-phone phone, resolves owners, and produces the
---lookups the porters use. Also tallies resolved / unresolved / ambiguous counts.
---
---Under per-phone keying the porters are handed one row identity per NUMBER rather than one per
---character, which is the whole of what makes a player's second phone keep its own data. Every
---porter reads `numberToCid` and nothing else, so that single substitution carries all of them.
---
---A phone whose number its own owner ALREADY holds here keeps that character identity, so a run
---against a database imported per character recognises those rows instead of copying them and only
---brings across the phones the earlier run left behind. A number held by anyone else is a genuine
---clash and the phone is skipped: importing it under an identity that cannot also hold the number
---would leave a phone carrying data with no service.
---
---The scheme is decided AND pinned here rather than in a porter: a porter that fails does not stop
---the run (see runner.execute), so a porter holding the pin could leave the data porters writing
---rows under a keying nothing recorded.
