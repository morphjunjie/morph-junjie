---@type table Crash curve module; the table returned at end of file. Pure arithmetic: no FiveM

---round busts and what multiplier a moment in time is worth - lives here so one suite can pin it.

---cannot silently raise the ceiling on a payout.

---@type number Growth rate per millisecond, e^(0.16/s). 2.00x lands at 4.33s and 100.00x at

---@type string Appended to the server seed before hashing to produce the round's published
