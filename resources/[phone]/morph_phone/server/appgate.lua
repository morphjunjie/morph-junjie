---and it exists because the answer changes with the job they are holding. The client has no job
---awareness of its own, so it asks on every open and gets the answer for the character that is
---actually loaded.
---
---Two things feed the answer: the terminal rule below, which derives itself from configs/mdt.lua so
---a new department cannot silently have no app, and any `requires` an entry carries, which
---server.gates evaluates. The terminal rule stays hand-written because it is derived rather than
---declared - there is no `requires` to put in configs/apps.lua that knows the MDT's departments.
