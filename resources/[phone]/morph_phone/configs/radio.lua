-- Radio app - numeric frequencies carried over morph_voice. RestrictedRanges gates
-- frequency bands to specific jobs: a frequency inside a listed range can only be
-- tuned by a player whose job is in that range's `jobs`. Ranges are inclusive and
-- may overlap (a player passes if they match ANY covering range); frequencies not
-- covered by any range are open to everyone. Leave the list empty for no limits.
