-- Weather app - pulls live in-game weather + world time from whichever
-- weathersync is running, so the Los Santos forecast reflects the real server

-- auto-detected; weather + time still work (off game natives) even with none.

-- Note: neither supported sync models a real temperature / humidity / UV /
-- multi-day forecast - GTA has no such concept - so those stay derived in the
-- app from the live weather + each city's climate profile.
