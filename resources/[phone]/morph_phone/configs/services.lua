    -- bank, employees, quit) - they just won't appear in the directory.
    -- `canCall` + `callNumber` give the company a phone line. It is dialable two
    -- ways: the Call button in the Services app, and typing the number into the
    -- Phone dialer, so 911 rings every on-duty officer exactly as the button does.

    -- reachable; leave canCall false and it stays directory-only.
    -- `bossGrade` is an ESX-ONLY fallback (overrides DefaultBossGrade for this
    -- company); QBCore/QBox ignore it and use the grade's isboss flag.
    -- `commission` is an OPTIONAL fraction 0.0-1.0 of a paid business invoice
    -- that goes to the sending employee, with the remainder going to the society
    -- account (the two always sum to the invoice amount, so no money is minted).
    -- Absent or 0 means the whole amount goes to the society. Only applies when a
    -- society bank is available; the no-society fallback already pays the sending
    -- employee in full, so no commission is split there.
